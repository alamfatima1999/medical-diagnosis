# Problem Statement
Since in a large hospital there are numerous departments and doctors specialising on their own. In such a situation there has to be a more generalised way to predict diseases based on the patient’s plea. In this prediction method, the goal is to link the patient’s complaint to possible diagnosis that a doctor would suggest regardless of depending to which field it belongs to. Sometimes it is unable to find out what exactly is the root cause of the problem and the patient might spend ranging from a week to a month or two to find out the exact cause. This is where this prediction model comes into picture whose ultimate aim is to give top predictions so that a patient’s time and effort is saved and quality healthcare is provided within a short time frame
